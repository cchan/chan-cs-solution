Since not all ways of multiplying matrices require the same
number of scalar multiplications, we will consider the following problem. The
matrix chain multiplication problem is defined as follows: given a sequence of
matrices A1, A2, . . . An, where Ai has dimensions pi−1×pi
, and Ai−1 and Ai are
compatible for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, determine the order of computing A1×A2×· · ·×An
with the minimum number of scalar multiplications. Note that the problem
does not ask you to multiply the matrices, just to figure out the optimal way of
multiplying them.
Let m[i, j] denote the optimal (minimal) number of scalar multiplications
to multiply matrices from an index i to an index j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) in a given
matrix sequence. m[i, j] is defined recursively as follows:
m[i, j] = (
0 if i = j
min
i≤k<j
{m[i, k] + m[k + 1, j] + pi−1 · pk · pj} if i < j
Apply this formula to determine the optimal way of multiplying A1 × A2 × A3
(i.e. the case when i = 1, j = 3) in the example in the previous problem. Also
determine the optimal way of multiplying A2 × A3 × A4. Show your work
