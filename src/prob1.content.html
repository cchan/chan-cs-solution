		<blockquote>What is $F_8$?</blockquote>
		<p>
			We can simply list out the numbers, each one being the sum of the two before:
			$$
			\begin{align*}
				F_1 &= 1,\\
				F_2 &= 1,\\
				F_3 &= 1+1=2,\\
				F_4 &= 1+2=3,\\
				F_5 &= 2+3=5,\\
				F_6 &= 3+5=8,\\
				F_7 &= 5+8=13,\\
				F_8 &= 8+13=21\\
			\end{align*}
			$$
			Therefore $F_8 = \boxed{21}$.

		<blockquote>Write a function that takes a single positive integer $n$ and returns $F_n$.</blockquote>
		This piece of code pretty much is exactly the definition, 
		except for the addition of <code>fibonacci(0) = 0</code> for completeness, and returning 0 for negative $n$.
		
		<div class="codeblock">
function fibonacci(n){
	if(n <= 0) return 0;
	else if(n <= 2) return 1;
	else return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}
console.log("fibonacci(1) = " + fibonacci(1)); //Should be 1
console.log("fibonacci(3) = " + fibonacci(3)); //Should be 2
console.log("fibonacci(8) = " + fibonacci(8)); //Should be 21
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<blockquote>How many function calls does your function make in order to compute $F_5$? What are those function calls?</blockquote>
		<p>
			Let $N_n$ be the number of times the <code>fibonacci()</code> function is called when <code>fibonacci(n)</code> is invoked.
			$N_1 = N_2 = 1$, since the function immediately returns.
			$N_3 = 3$, counting the call to <code>fibonacci(3)</code>, which in turn calls <code>fibonacci(2)</code> and <code>fibonacci(1)</code>.
			Thus, $N_i = 1 + N_{i-1} + N_{i-2}$.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first few terms of $N_i$ are $1, 1, 3, 5, 9$. We're looking for $N_5 = 9$, so the final answer is $\boxed{9}$ invocations of the function.
		</p>
		
		<p>The specific calls can be obtained like the following, by mapping out the calls in a tree:</p>
		
		<div style="text-align:center;"><pre style="text-align:left;display:inline-block;">
F(5)
 |_______________   
 |               |
F(4)            F(3)
 |_______        |________
 |       |       |        |
F(3)    F(2)    F(2)     F(1)
 |____ 
 |    |
F(2)  F(1)
		</pre></div>
		<p class="noindent">which also results in the same answer of $\boxed{9}$ total calls. 
		This results in some annoyance, as $F_3$ is used twice yet it recomputes itself both times. Time for some memoization ;)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<blockquote>Explain how the number of these calls would grow when $n$ increases. Why is this not a reasonable way of computing Fibonacci numbers?</blockquote>
		
		<p>As the definition of $N$ in the previous part includes two previous terms of $N$, the number of calls to <code>fibonacci()</code> should grow approximately as $O(2^n)$.
		Since exponential functions get rather big rather fast, it would be quite unreasonable to compute, say, 
		a mere <code>fibonacci(100)</code>. It would take around $708449696358523500000$ calls (JavaScript doesn't even have enough floating-point precision to know the exact number):</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock">
var N = [0, 1, 1]; //Predefine N_1 and N_2 as 1.
for(var i = 3; i <= 100; i++) //Up to N_100
	N[i] = N[i-1] + N[i-2] + 1; //As defined in #3: N_i = 1 + N_(i-1) + N_(i-2)
console.log("N_100 = " + N[100]);
		</div>
