			Prove or disprove: The optimal number of copies can always be achieved

		<p>I feel like this is true, but don't know how to approach it. 
		Particularly, I tested a few examples where there were two possibilities for the "middle" break since they were equidistant from the actual middle, 
		and they turned out to give the optimal solution either way.</p>
		<p>Well, when in doubt, test random examples:</p>

	var breakorder = [[]]; //Stores the break orders for each element in the tree
	var len = breaks.length + 1; //The number of segments. Useful because breaks[0] and breaks[len] are going to be added as the extremes.
	
	//Add in B_0 = 0 and B_N = L so things generalize a little bit better (rather than using prolific if statements)
	breaks.splice(0,0,0);
	breaks[len] = strlength;
	
	for(var i = 0; i <= len; i++){
		tree[i] = [];

        //Initialize the break-order expressions - you don't break any strings when the indices are only one apart
		breakorder[i] = [];
		breakorder[i][i + 1] = "";
	}
	
	for(var treerow = 2; treerow <= len; treerow++){ //For each row of the tree after the 1st,
		for(var i = 0; i <= len - treerow; i++){ //For each element of that row,
			var j = i + treerow;
			
			//we find the cost formula's minimum across all k
			var mincost = tree[i][i+1] + tree[i+1][j] + breaks[j] - breaks[i]; //(initialize with first iteration of loop (k=i+1), to avoid setting min = some arbitrary large number)
			var mink = i+1;

				var cost = tree[i][k] + tree[k][j] + breaks[j] - breaks[i];
				if(cost < mincost){mincost = cost; mink = k;}
			}
			tree[i][j] = mincost; //and set that element in the tree to be that minimum cost
			breakorder[i][j] = breaks[mink]
				+ ((breakorder[i][mink]!="")? ", " + breakorder[i][mink]: "")
				+ ((breakorder[mink][j]!="")? ", " + breakorder[mink][j]: ""); //and use that minimizing k to figure out the break-order

			<p>Thus a contradiction is found: when $L=7$ and $B = [2, 3, 4]$. 
			But it looks like just that the middle method can't decide where to put the break between two breaks equally close to the middle, 
			so it chose the wrong one. Maybe it needs to be able to figure out which. I thus modified the <code>costMiddle</code> function 
			to become <code>costMiddleMultiple</code>, which, whenever it finds two breaks equally close to the middle, will test both breaks and pick the better one.</p>
			<p>Fascinatingly, it's <i>still</i> wrong. When $L=8$ and $B = [3, 4, 5]$, <code>costMiddleMultiple</code> will break it at 4 first, followed by 3 and 5, resulting in a total cost of 16,
			but the most efficient way is actually to break at 3 and 5 first, then at 4 last, resulting in a total cost of 15.</p>
			<p>Well, it looked intuitively right (and usually actually gets pretty close), but apparently it's wrong in the general case.</p>
