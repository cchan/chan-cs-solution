		<blockquote>How many function calls does your program make for $n = 5$? For $n = 100$?</blockquote>
		<p>The number of function calls is far lower than in Problem 1, since in many cases the number has already been calculated.
		There are three possible reasons <code>fibonacci(n)</code> could be called:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is the original invocation of <code>fibonacci()</code>. This is a single invocation.</li>
			<li>It is being called by <code>fibonacci(n+1)</code>. Once it is called, it will not be called again by <code>fibonacci(n+1)</code>, since <code>cache[n+1]</code> will have a hit.</li>
			<li>It is being called by <code>fibonacci(n+2)</code>. Just as above, it will not be called again by <code>fibonacci(n+2)</code>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="noindent">A special case occurs when $n=1$, since <code>fibonacci(2)</code> immediately returns and will never call <code>fibonacci(1)</code>. All numbers of invocations are thus listed in the table.</p>
		<div style="text-align:center;">
		$$
			\begin{matrix}
			\text{Value of n in f(n)} & n & n-1 & n-2 & n-3 & ... & 3 & 2 & 1\\
			\text{Number of invocations of f(n)} & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & ... & 2 & 2 & 1\\
			\end{matrix}
		$$
		</div>
		<p>Therefore the total number of invocations of the function would be $2n-3$.</p>
		
		<p>We can verify these predictions by adding a counter to <code>fibonacciMemoized</code>:</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock">
var cache = [0, 1, 1];
var counter = 0;
function fibonacciMemoized(n){
	counter++;
	
	if(cache[n] !== undefined)
		return cache[n];
	else
		return cache[n] = fibonacciMemoized(n-1) + fibonacciMemoized(n-2);
}

fibonacciMemoized(5);
console.log(counter); //Should be 2 * 5 - 3 = 7

//Reset the counter and cache so that it doesn't affect this fresh run
counter = 0; cache = [0, 1, 1];
fibonacciMemoized(100);
console.log(counter); //Should be 2 * 100 - 3 = 197
		</div>
		
		<p>Thus the total number of function calls for <code>fibonacci(5)</code> is $\boxed{7}$, and the total number for <code>fibonacci(100)</code> is $\boxed{197}$. Much better than $O(~2^n)$ - it's $O(n)$.</p>
